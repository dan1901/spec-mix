# Spec Mix Documentation

### Core Philosophy

Following the original Spec Kit approach:

1. **Specification First** - Define what you're building before how
2. **AI-Powered** - Leverage AI agents for implementation
3. **Iterative** - Refine specifications through dialog
4. **Quality Focused** - Built-in validation and review processes

### Enhanced Features

Spec Mix adds three major enhancements:

- **🌍 Multi-Language Support** - Full internationalization with language packs
- **🎯 Mission System** - Domain-specific workflow templates
- **📊 Web Dashboard** - Visual project management interface
