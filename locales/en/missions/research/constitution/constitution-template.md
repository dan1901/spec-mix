# Research Constitution: [PROJECT NAME]

## Core Research Principles

### 1. Evidence-Based Analysis
- All conclusions must be supported by evidence
- Distinguish between facts and interpretations
- Acknowledge when evidence is insufficient
- Avoid speculation beyond what data supports

### 2. Source Quality and Citation
- Prioritize credible, authoritative sources
- Cite all sources properly and consistently
- Evaluate source reliability and potential bias
- Maintain a comprehensive bibliography

### 3. Intellectual Honesty
- Report findings accurately, even if unexpected
- Acknowledge limitations and uncertainties
- Disclose any conflicts of interest
- Do not cherry-pick data to support desired conclusions

### 4. Multiple Perspectives
- Consider alternative viewpoints and interpretations
- Seek out diverse sources and perspectives
- Challenge your own assumptions
- Acknowledge where experts disagree

### 5. Methodological Rigor
- Document research methodology clearly
- Use appropriate analysis methods
- Ensure reproducibility where possible
- Explain analytical choices and their rationale

### 6. Critical Thinking
- Question assumptions and conventional wisdom
- Evaluate arguments for logical consistency
- Distinguish correlation from causation
- Recognize and avoid common reasoning fallacies

### 7. Continuous Learning
- Update understanding as new evidence emerges
- Revise conclusions when warranted by evidence
- Document evolution of thinking
- Remain open to being proven wrong

## Research Workflow

1. **Define Question**: Clearly articulate what you're investigating
2. **Review Literature**: Understand existing knowledge
3. **Collect Data**: Gather relevant evidence systematically
4. **Analyze Findings**: Apply rigorous analysis methods
5. **Synthesize**: Draw evidence-based conclusions
6. **Document**: Record findings, methodology, and limitations
7. **Review**: Validate through peer review

## Quality Standards

Before finalizing research:
- [ ] Research question clearly defined
- [ ] Multiple credible sources consulted
- [ ] All sources properly cited
- [ ] Methodology documented
- [ ] Limitations acknowledged
- [ ] Alternative interpretations considered
- [ ] Conclusions supported by evidence
- [ ] Findings documented clearly

## Decision Framework

When evaluating evidence:
1. **Source Credibility**: Is the source authoritative and reliable?
2. **Evidence Quality**: Is the evidence direct, robust, and relevant?
3. **Consistency**: Does it align with other credible sources?
4. **Recency**: Is the information current and up-to-date?
5. **Completeness**: Are we missing important context or data?

## Red Flags to Avoid

- Confirmation bias (seeking only supporting evidence)
- Overgeneralization from limited data
- Ignoring contradictory evidence
- Relying on unreliable or biased sources
- Making claims beyond what evidence supports
- Failing to document methodology
- Presenting opinion as fact
